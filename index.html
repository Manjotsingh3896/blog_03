                The author discusses the slow progress of robotics in agriculture and mentions a new agtech robot partnership between Growmark and Solinftec, which autonomously scans fields for crop health, pests, and weeds, providing real-time data to farmers for action. This technology aims to improve farming practices and compete with other monitoring methods and multi-functional robots in the agricultural sector.</p>
